* About

** About the person

Why are you reading this? I'm not that interesting, i'm just a guy who
writes blogposts and software. You can do that too. Stop caring so
much about others and start caring about yourself.

** Projects
Some projects I have worked on are [[https://git.suragu.net/sakisafe.git][sakisafe]], a simple file sharing
program and it's terminal interface. There are also the [[https://git.suragu.net/k9core.git][coreutils]] I
wrote and a lot of [[https://git.suragu.net/love_sosa][scripts]] I have written during the time. The source
code of my blog is available at [[https://git.suragu.net/dudemanweed/the_pit.git][the_pit]]
