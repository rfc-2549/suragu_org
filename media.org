* Media I've consumed
Well, someone has said, that in this world there are people for
everything, or "it takes all sorts to make a world", so there must be
someone interested on the media I consume and what I think about
it. So here are music albums, movies and similar.

As i'm not a professional rater, I'm not gonna rate them, in numbers,
i'll just say what I think about the thing and that's it.

Pssss. You can get some of the media listed [[https://files.suragu.net/][here]]. 

** Movies
I love the "guy who think he's cool" cinema.

- *Pulp Fiction (1994)*: The movie is stupid, ridicolous and most
  pejorative adjectives you can think of. But it's my favorite movie
  nevertheless.
- *Kill Bill (2003-2004)*: Good movies.
- *Trainspotting (1996)*: Movie about [[https://concealed.world/home.php][Scottish Drug addicts]]. The thing
  sends a Good Message. And the movie is really enjoyable.
- *T2 Trainspotting (2017)*: Not as good as the original but still
  passable.
- *Ghost in the Shell (1995)*: It's the only anime movie i've
  watched. It's pretty cyberpunk so i like it.
- *Torrente: El brazo tonto de la ley (1997)*: Fucking funny garbage, if
  i wasn't high i wouldn't have liked the thing.
- *Torrente 2: Misión en Marbella*: Idem
- *El día de la Bestia (1995)*: My favorite movie this country has made
- *Acción mutante (1993)*: One of the movies i laughed the most
- *Fear and loathing in Las Vegas (1998)*: I don't know what I watched
- *Scarface (1983)*: Masterpiece.
- *Navajeros (1980)*: Funny at times but didn't like it at all.
- *El pico (1983)*: Way better than Navajeros and has a cool message.
- *El pico 2 (1984)*: 🎵Hay veces que me siento solo y pienso, Quisiera
  yo cambiar el mundo mío, Quisiera yo coger a las estrellas para
  poder ponerlas en mi camino🎵
- *Scary Movie (2000):* Utter shit. But THC boosts movies.
- *Ali G Indahouase:* ???
- *The Godfather (1972):* Masterpiece
- *Lady Snowblood (1973):* I loved Kill Bill. I loved this even more.
- *The great lebowski:* Same as fear and loathing in las vegas.
** Videogames
Well, now I got a decent computer in which I can play games
decently. I have completed all the storyline of these games unless
stated otherwhise.

- *Borderlands 2:* One of my favorite games.
- *Borderlands: The Pre-sequel*: Still playing it
- *Milk (out|in)side a bag of milk (out|in)side a bag of milk*: Had a [[./img/funny.png][funny frame]]
** Anime
I genuinely believe that all anime are garbage. 
- *Serial Experiments Lain*: The anime is cool. I used to simp for Lain
  but then I discovered I'm suragu, not a insecure, twitter user
- *Paranoia Agent*: I remember once a linguistics teacher I had told me
  to watch this anime. I watched it and I really enjoyed it. A good
  satire. I have keked big to this one.
- *Texhnolyze*: Made by the same guys that made Lain. But i enjoyed this
  one more than Lain
- *Haibane Renmei*: Made by the same guy as Lain and Texhnolyze, this is
  the only media that made me cry and i have 0 problems admitting it.
- *The curse of Kazuo Umezu*: I can't take gore animes seriously
  because I analyze the situation, which makes me laugh
  uncontrollably. Altough it was fun to watch.
- *Shoujo Tsubaki (1992)* : The thing stated above doesn't apply for this
  one. This one is actually depressing.
- *Belladonna of Sadness (1973)*: Masterpiece. The Japanese version of
  Pink Floyd's The Wall. Psychedelic, deep, and weird.
- *Jigoku Shoujo*: This death note and paranoia agent but with a
  anime girl instead of a guy with a baseball bat. It also had a
  [[./img/hell_marijuana.jpg][sublimal message]]
- *Perfect Blue (1997)*: Psychosis.  

** Books
I know how to read

- *Neuromancer (1984)*: A drugaddict hacker needs to make money but he
  can't work because he stole from his bosses.

** Music
This shit will never be complete.
