* suragu.net tech posts

I have a [[../blog/][blog]], but I to keep it to very weird things that come to my
mind that don't require text formatting, images, or anything that is
not plain text.

The intention of this section of my website is to make a space for all
the weird things that are related with tech. Which mostly always
require formatting like syntax highlighting, images, or monospaced
text. So I decided to create this section for the tech related posts.

These articles are sorted from oldest to newest.
