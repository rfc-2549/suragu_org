* How to play the guitar in Void Linux

I started working as a sysadmin somewhat recently, since my work is to
fight computers, I no longer enjoy fighting computers, so I had to
find a new hobby. After trying to find a new hobby, I find myself
being one of the guys from "The Kids Aren't Alright" by The Offspring,
because now I just play the guitar and smoke a lot of pot.

Normally, you'd connect a guitar to an amplifier so you can play
it. But some of us, me included, live with unsuffriable family members
who hate to see you happy and will complain about certain aromas or
noise. So what you can do is to use your computer as an amplifier. To
use this you'll need some hardware:

- [[../img/guitar.jpg][An electric guitar]]
- A sound card (I use the prodipe studio 22+ because a friend of mine
  sold it for a reasonable price and it's a great soundcard)
- Headphones that support 6.5 jack entries. I use Pioneer HDJ 1500
  because my mom's a DJ, with this model you can change between 3.5mm
  and 6.5mm at will. Pretty epic.
- Everything else you need to play a guitar

** Linux setup

I use Void Linux for autistic reasons. Playing the guitar just worked
with the following setup. I could become Syd Barrett easily. But one
day the JACK shat itself and pulseaudio became autistic. I could not
find any solution to keep using Pulse Audio, which ended up in me
discovering the best piece of software known to humankind: pipewire.

Pipewire is just a sound server like pulseaudio, with the difference
that this one does not sucks ass cock and balls.

So basically, first you stop PulseAudio from starting at login, not so
hard, just remove pulseaudio.desktop form =/etc/xdg/autostart= And
then install pipewire and the necessary plugins.

#+begin_src bash
# xbps-install pipewire pipewire-pulse libjack-pipewire alsa-plugins-jack cadence guitarrix tuxguitar
#+end_src

pipewire-pulse is a layer of compatibility of pipewire with
pulseaudio, libjack-pipewire is a embeded jack server onto pipewire or
something like this. Which is extremely epic in my opinion. Cadence is
a jack configurator (comes with more software you want to
use). Guitarrix is a amplifier emulator and TuxGuitar is just a
software that reads .gpx files so you can learn to play your favorite
songs.

After installing pipewire, first you create autostarts to autostart
pipewire and pipewire-pulse (in that order). To do this just do this:

#+begin_src bash
  ln -s /usr/share/applications/pipewire.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/pipewire.desktop

#+end_src

Then manually create one startup option for pipewire-pulse in your DE
configuration, if you're using an autistic window manager like dwm you
should know how to do this.

After adding those rules, log off and log in, and run =pactl info= it
should output something like =PulseAudio (on PipeWire 0.3.68)= This
basically means that your PulseAudio server is just PipeWire, you're
using pipewire but you can also use pipewire to work as pulseaudio,
and jack.

** Making the thing work

Alright, connect your 6.5 jack headphones to the sound card, plug the
soundcard to the computer, change the audio output (through
=pavucontrol= or anything) to the soundcard, play any song and you'll
know what a FLAC sounds like. Then you connect the guitar, play a few
chords, and it sounds through the sound card ("the prodipe" from now
on). So you're almost ready. Now you have to use pipewire's jack
server to configure the audio flow. First open Guitarix and Catia with the
following command:

#+begin_src bash
  $ pw-jack guitarix &
  $ pw-jack catia &
#+end_src

This will launch Guitarix (guitar amplifier) and Catia, a software to
plug and unplug audios through jack.

So you have to connect your guitar to Guitarix and then from
Guitarix to the desired output, like this:

After that, just go to Guitarix and add enough effects so you sound
like Alice in Chains. And have fun.
