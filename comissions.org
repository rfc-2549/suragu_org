* Comissions

I have been sponsored to do some reviews, in this page I intend to
have a special site in the website for those marijuanas who touched my
heart.

If you're my fucking father, donate to make a review, Monero:

If you send "[[./img/izaskun.jpg][propin]]" be sure to notify me because I check the monero
wallet very rarely.

For comments, hit me up at melendi@riseup.net

** Gold Extraction 22k (Hash, 22 EUR/gram)

This hash was literally keef, smelled like grass, at first we smoked a
green (something legendary in this region of the world, we're
poorfags) with this hash. According to the dude who talked us about
this, this was "crazy shit", we believed him. Anyways, the joint was
an incredible one, things is that because we are idiots, we added a
shitton of hash and a shitton of another expensive grass to the
bong. My friend hit it first and nigga didn't feel anything, I hit it
and I was instantly transported to the Marijuana Shadow Realmâ„¢. I
don't remember many things about that hour and a half of my life. Some
frames I have from those moments were:

1. A friend of mine in ambulance mode to gave me coke (the drink, not
   the drug)
2. My other friend doing research and getting an acuarius as donation
   from the club because of my condition.
3. Puked three times   
4. [[./img/narturo.jpg][This romanian motherfucker]] spawning with a kebab to save my
   godforsaken soul.
   
That's all I remember. I recommend it

** Red Sangria (Grass, 12 EUR/Gram)
   
To be written, still have to smoke it.

CONT: Smoked it. Was so good I forgot to do the review.
